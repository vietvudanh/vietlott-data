# ðŸŽ° Vietlott Data

## Project Overview

This project is a Python application designed to automatically crawl, analyze, and store data from the Vietnamese lottery website, Vietlott.vn. It provides a command-line interface to fetch data for various lottery products, and it automatically generates an updated `readme.md` file with the latest statistics and analysis.

The project is well-structured, with separate modules for crawling, data modeling, and command-line interfaces. It uses a modular design with a base class for crawling and specific implementations for each lottery product.

**Key Technologies:**

*   Python
*   `click` for the CLI
*   `polars` for data manipulation
*   `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web crawling
*   `pytest` for testing
*   `ruff` for linting
*   `uv` for package management
*   GitHub Actions for CI/CD and automated data crawling

## Building and Running

The project uses a `Makefile` to streamline common development tasks.

**Key Commands:**

*   **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    make requirements-dev
    ```
*   **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
*   **Lint the code:**
    ```bash
    make lint
    ```
*   **Run the crawler:**
    ```bash
    make run-crawl
    ```
*   **Run the missing data detection:**
    ```bash
    make run-missing
    ```
*   **Generate the `readme.md` file:**
    ```bash
    uv run python src/render_readme.py
    ```

## Development Conventions

The `AGENTS.md` file provides specific instructions for developers and AI agents working on this project.

*   **Package Management:** Use `uv` for all package management tasks.
*   **Virtual Environment:** Always activate the virtual environment before running any commands (`source .venv/bin/activate`).
*   **Linting:** Run `make lint` after all code changes to ensure code style consistency.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Run unit tests with `PYTHON_PATH=src uv run pytest -q src/vietlott/tests`.
    *   Verify the main flow by running `uv run python src/render_readme.py` and `uv run python src/vietlott/cli/crawl.py power_645` after any code changes.
*   **`readme.md`:** Do not edit `readme.md` directly. It is generated by `src/render_readme.py`.
